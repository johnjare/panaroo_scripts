# pair_diff.py
# Source: https://github.com/johnjare
# Created by Jared Johnson
#
# Calculates pairwise gene and SNP differences between isolates in a supplied presence/absence matrix and VCF file generated using Panaroo or Roary.
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Example:
# 
# > python3 pair_diff.py -g gene_presence_absence.Rtab -s core_snps.vcf -o gene_snp_differences.csv -t genes
# 
# Inputs:
# gene_presence_absence.Rtab - presence/absence matrix generated by Roary or Panaroo
# core_snps.vcf - VCF file generated from SNP-sites
#
# Outputs:
# gene_snp_differences.csv - table of pairwise gene and SNP differences
